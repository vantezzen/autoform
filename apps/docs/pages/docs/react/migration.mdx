# Migration

This guide will help you migrate from the old, pure shadcn/ui component to the new AutoForm library.

Please note that the new library does not have full feature-partity with the old one - specifically, it does not support the following features (yet):

- AutoForm doesn't use `react-hook-form` under the hood, so information about the form state is not available
- Custom parent components
- Custom order
- Dependencies between fields
- Declaring custom field components inline

But the new AutoForm library has a lot of new features, such as:

- Support for any array, not just arrays of objects
- Support for other schema libraries, not just zod
- Cleaner, in-schema fieldConfig definition
- Cleaner shadcn/ui components, as they are now just wrappers around the AutoForm library

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

<Steps>
## Remove existing shadcn/ui component

First, remove the `components/ui/auto-form` folder from your project.

## Install AutoForm

To install AutoForm, run the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vantezzen/autoform/refs/heads/main/packages/shadcn/registry/autoform.json
npm install @autoform/zod
```

## Update form components

The new AutoForm uses the `autoform` folder for a more consistent naming schema.

You also need to wrap your schema in a `ZodProvider` and pass it to the `AutoForm` component. Instead of passing the `AutoFormSubmit` component as a child of `AutoForm`, you can simply use the `withSubmit` prop.

```diff
- import AutoForm, { AutoFormSubmit } from "@/components/ui/auto-form";
+ import { AutoForm } from "@/components/ui/autoform";
+ import { ZodProvider } from "@autoform/zod";

const mySchema = z.object({
  // ...
});

+ const schemaProvider = new ZodProvider(mySchema);

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <AutoForm
-     formSchema={mySchema}
+     schema={schemaProvider}
      onSubmit={(data) => {
        console.log(data);
      }}
-     fieldConfig={...}
+     withSubmit
    >
-     <AutoFormSubmit />
    </AutoForm>
  );
}
```

## Update fieldConfig

Instead of passing the `fieldConfig` prop to the `AutoForm` component, you can now define the field config directly in the schema using the `fieldConfig` function.

```diff
import * as z from "zod";
+ import { fieldConfig } from "@autoform/zod";
+ import { FieldTypes } from "@/components/ui/autoform";

const formSchema = z.object({
  password: z
    .string()
    .min(8, {
      message: "Please use a secure password.",
    })
+   .superRefine(
+     fieldConfig<React.ReactNode, FieldTypes>({
+       description: "We recommend to use a strong password.",
+       inputProps: {
+         type: "password",
+       },
+     })
+   ),
});
```

## Update callbacks

If you are only using `onSubmit`, your code should be able to work without any changes. If you are using controlled input instead, you need to update your code to use the new `onFormInit` prop to get manual access to the form instance.

```tsx
const [values, setValues] = useState({});

<AutoForm
  onFormInit={(form) => {
    // You can use the "form" prop to access the underlying "react-hook-form" instance
    // https://www.react-hook-form.com/api/useform/
    form.watch((data) => {
      setValues(data);
    });

    // You can freely save the form instance to a state or context and use it later to access the form state
    form.formState.isDirty; // => true
  }}
  values={values}
/>;
```

</Steps>
