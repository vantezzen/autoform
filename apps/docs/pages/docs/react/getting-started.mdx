<Steps>
## Install AutoForm's integration to your UI library

AutoForm integrates directly into your UI library to render forms. You can choose from the following official integrations:

- For Material UI: `npm install @autoform/mui`
- For Mantine: `npm install @autoform/mantine`
- For Ant Design: `npm install @autoform/ant`
- For shadcn/ui: `npx shadcn@latest add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vantezzen/autoform/refs/heads/main/packages/shadcn/registry/autoform.json`

  Use `import { AutoForm } from "@/components/ui/autoform"` to import the component. By default, the registry will use the zod integration. If you want to use another schema library, simply update the `/components/ui/autoform/utils.ts` file.

- more to come...

If you want to integrate into your own UI components or another UI library, check out the [custom integration guide](/docs/react/custom-integration).

In the docs, we will use Material UI as an example but simply replace the imports with the ones from your UI library.

## Install AutoForm's integration to your schema library

- `npm install @autoform/zod` for Zod
- `npm install @autoform/yup` for Yup
- more to come...

In the docs, we will use Zod as an example but simply replace the imports with the ones from your schema library.

## Create a form

```tsx
import { AutoForm } from "@autoform/mui";
import { ZodProvider } from "@autoform/zod";

const mySchema = z.object({
  // ...
});
const schemaProvider = new ZodProvider(mySchema);

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <AutoForm
      schema={schemaProvider}
      onSubmit={(data, form) => {
        console.log(data);
      }}
      withSubmit
    />
  );
}
```

</Steps>

## Next.js and RSC

AutoForm can only be used inside a client-side React component due to serialization of the schema and values to your event listeners. If you want to use it in a Next.js app, simply mark your component with "use client":

```tsx
// MyPage.tsx
export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyForm />
    </div>
  );
}

// MyForm.tsx
"use client";
import { AutoForm } from "@autoform/mui";
export default function MyForm() {
  return <AutoForm ... />;
}
```

## Accessing the form data

The form data is managed by react-hook-form. There are two ways to access the form data:

### onSubmit

The preferred way is to use the `onSubmit` prop. This will be called when the form is submitted and the data is valid.

```tsx
<AutoForm
  onSubmit={(data, form) => {
    // Do something with the data
    // Data is validated and coerced with zod automatically
    // You can use the "form" prop to access the underlying "react-hook-form" instance
    // for further information and control over the form
  }}
/>
```

### Using onFormInit and `values`

If you need more control over the form, you can use the `onFormInit` and `values` props to get access to the react-hook-form instance and control data directly:

```tsx
const [values, setValues] = useState({});

<AutoForm
  onFormInit={(form) => {
    // You can use the "form" prop to access the underlying "react-hook-form" instance
    // https://www.react-hook-form.com/api/useform/
    form.watch((data) => {
      setValues(data);
    });

    // You can freely save the form instance to a state or context and use it later to access the form state
    form.formState.isDirty; // => true
  }}
  values={values}
/>;
```

This allows you to access form methods and state from the parent component. You can use the `onFormInit` prop independent of controlled forms to access the form instance.

## Passing props to the form element

You can pass additional props to the underlying form element using the `formProps` prop:

```tsx
<AutoForm
  schema={schemaProvider}
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  formProps={{
    className: "my-custom-form-class",
    onKeyDown: (e) => {
      if (e.key === "Enter") e.preventDefault();
    },
  }}
/>
```

This allows you to customize the form element's attributes and behavior as needed.

## Submitting the form

You can use the `withSubmit` prop to automatically add a submit button to the form.

```tsx
<AutoForm
  // ...
  withSubmit
/>
```

## Adding other elements

All children passed to the `AutoForm` component will be rendered below the form.

```tsx
<AutoForm>
  <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm">
    By submitting this form, you agree to our{" "}
    <a href="#" className="text-primary underline">
      terms and conditions
    </a>
    .
  </p>
</AutoForm>
```
