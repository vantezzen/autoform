The `schema` prop is used to pass the schema to the form. It can be a `ZodProvider`, `YupProvider` or `JoiProvider`.

## onSubmit?: (values: T, form: FormInstance) => void

The `onSubmit` prop is called when the form is submitted and the data is valid. It receives the form data and the form instance from react-hook-form.

## onFormInit?: (form: FormInstance) => void

The `onFormInit` prop is called when the form is initialized. It receives the form instance from react-hook-form.

## withSubmit?: boolean

The `withSubmit` prop is used to automatically add a submit button to the form. It defaults to `false`.

## defaultValues?: Partial\<T>

The `defaultValues` prop is used to set the initial values of the form.

## values: Partial\<T>

The `values` prop is used to set the values of the form. It is a controlled input.

## children: React.ReactNode

All children passed to the `AutoForm` component will be rendered below the form.

## formComponents: Partial\<AutoFormFieldComponents>

Additional, custom form components can be passed to the `formComponents` prop. This allows you to add custom field types to the form.

## uiComponents: Partial\<AutoFormUIComponents>

Override the default UI components with custom components. This allows you to customize the look and feel of the form.

## formProps?: React.ComponentProps\<'form'>

The `formProps` prop allows you to pass additional props directly to the underlying form element. This can be useful for adding custom attributes, event handlers, or other properties to the form.
